// The editor of rendered Markdown as a custom text editor of VS Code (docs/requirements.md, R-TEXT-010, R-VSC-001 to
// R-VSC-003): the file stays a text document of VS Code, so that saving, the dirty mark, hot exit, Git, the timeline and
// the other extensions work as for the text editor. The extension, for example Notes, registers the editor with its own
// view type and gives the script of its page, which creates the editor in the webview. This code connects the page to
// the document: it sends the text and each change of the document to the page, and makes each change of the user in
// the page a change of the document (src/adapter/messages.ts). VS Code does not say who made a change of the document, so the
// page gives each such change the origin `program` with the name `vscode`.
//
// A Markdown file has three views in the place of its editor (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-002): the text editor, the
// Markdown preview of VS Code and this editor. The commands of the registration open the file of the active editor in
// another view, with the command `reopenActiveEditorWith` of VS Code, which also the list of the editors of VS Code
// uses. A document that only shows a file, for example a document of the clean editing view of Notes, opens the editor
// of the file itself (the option `fileOf`). A file that the user chose for this editor opens in it also when the option
// `opens` returns false for it.
//
// The page shows the editor ("Edit") or the pages of the file in its layout ("Pages", docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-007).
// The commands of the extension switch the view of the active panel; the context key `<view type>.pages` is true while
// the active panel shows the pages, so that the title of the editor shows the button of the other view. For the pages,
// the page reads the files of the layouts through the extension, only from the folders from which it may load files.
//
// The plugins of the editor of other extensions (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-008): with the
// option `contributedPlugins`, the page loads the scripts that the package.json of another extension names in the
// contribution point `nimblescape.markdown.extensions`, for example the plugins of Paper in the editor of Notes. The
// part of such a plugin in the other extension connects later, through `addPlugin` of the registration; the messages
// that its part on the page sends before wait for it.
//
// The rendered changes (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-009): the package.json of the extension asks for the editor in the
// diffs of VS Code, with `"priority": { "textEditor": "default", "diffEditor": "default" }` (VS Code 1.125 and later).
// VS Code then opens the editor on both sides of a diff, each side a panel of its own, and the API of VS Code knows no
// input for the tab of such a diff. So a panel that opens while the active tab of its group has no input is a side of
// a diff, and the next panel that opens for the same tab soon after is the other side: the code connects the two. It
// gives each page its side and the text of the other side, and carries the heights of the rows and the scroll place
// between the two pages. The commands of the registration go to the next and the previous change, with the context
// key `<view type>.diff`, which is true while the active tab is such a diff.
//
// The extensions of the Markdown preview of VS Code (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-010): the editor shows the syntax that
// other extensions add to the Markdown preview, for example diagrams and math, without a change of these extensions
// (src/adapter/preview.ts). The code renders the blocks of the document with their plugins in the extension host and
// sends the page each block that they show in another way, with its HTML, after `init` and after each change of the
// document; the page loads their style sheets and scripts. The option `previewExtensions` turns this off.
//
// The code gets the API of VS Code as a parameter and imports no module `vscode`, so that the tests give it an API of
// their own; it uses no Node.js API, so that it runs in the extension host of the web as well.
