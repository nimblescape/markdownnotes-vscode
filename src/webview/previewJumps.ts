/**
 * The way back after a jump in the Markdown preview ([R-TEXT-011](../../docs/requirements.md#r-text-011)), the bundle
 * `dist/previewJumps.js` of `markdown.previewScripts`: a click on a link to a place of the document that moves the
 * preview, for example an entry of a table of contents, a cross reference, a citation or a footnote, keeps the place
 * before the click, and Go Back and Go Forward return through the places, with the keys that the user binds to Go Back
 * and Go Forward of VS Code, with the back and forward buttons of the mouse and with the buttons "Back" and "Forward" at the bottom
 * right of the preview, which show while there is a place in their direction (`installPageJumps` of
 * `@nimblescape/markdownrender/jumps`). Without a place, a key goes on to VS Code. On Windows, VS Code gives the mouse
 * buttons to its own commands Go Back and Go Forward, so the preview leaves them to VS Code. The places belong to the
 * file of the preview and stay over a load of the page again, which VS Code does for each change of the selected note;
 * nimblescape Markdown Paper installs the same jumps in its pages, and the page keeps one set of them.
