// The page side of the editor in a webview of VS Code (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-001, R-VSC-002, R-VSC-005): a TextSource that holds the text of the document of VS Code. The editors of the page work with the
// source; each change of the user goes to the extension, and each change of the document comes into the source with
// the origin `program` and the name `vscode` (src/adapter/messages.ts). The page sends one change at a time: a change that the
// user makes while the extension has not yet answered waits, and goes with the next message.
//
// The page shows the editor ("Edit") or the frame of the pages ("Pages", docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-007): the
// connection shows one of the two elements and tells the script of the page each switch. For the pages, the connection
// gives the host of the layout part: it reads the files of the layouts through the extension, and maps the URI of a
// file to its address in the webview.
//
// In a diff of VS Code, the page is one side (docs/requirements.md, R-VSC-009): the connection gives the side, the text of
// the other side with each new text, and carries the heights of the rows and the scroll place between the two pages;
// `followDiff` connects them with the rendered changes of the editor. The older side cannot change.
//
// The connection keeps the blocks that the extensions of the Markdown preview of VS Code show (docs/requirements.md,
// R-VSC-010) in `preview`; the plugin of src/webview/previewPlugin.ts shows them in the editor.
//
// VS Code gives each key of a webview to its own key bindings as well, and Undo and Redo of a custom text editor work
// on the document of VS Code, step by step as the page sent the changes. A key that the page handled, and Undo and Redo
// in a field of text, stay in the page, so that Undo of the editor undoes the steps of the user and a key of the
// editor, for example Ctrl+K for a link, starts no key binding of VS Code.
